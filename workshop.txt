title=Flamingo Fix
description=By default Flamingo's are incorrectly defined as a floor tile.  Anytime you place something behind them, or snow accumulates the flamingo goes invisible.  This fixes that by properly setting setting the flamingo definition as an object so that it appears in world like every other piece of furniture and decoration.
